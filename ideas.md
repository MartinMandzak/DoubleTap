*Double tap brainstorming board*
--------------------------------
- Probably in Godot, 3D
	- Godot it is!

- Will try to look for some free assets (?) otherwise ggs we gotta learn Blender
	- Well got some free models but I still have no idea how shit works

- Double barrel shotgun, snappy reload animation

- Wallriding and a double jump for sure

- Reload skipping (?) ... tapping the reload button again

- Incentivise aggressive gameplay, kinda like ultrakill's healing mechanic
    - To be determined

- Sound effects, sfxer mostly

- Definitely needs abilities, either per weapon or some other kind of skilltree

- Don't forget Fiverr exists lmao
	- If the game's good get OST commisioned

### Roadmap (?)
- Make a first scene and a PC with basic movement, shooting would be a bonus - no hit detection
